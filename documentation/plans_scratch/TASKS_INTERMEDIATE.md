# Intermediate Tasks (Canonical)

Use this file as the single source of truth for intermediate execution tasks.

## Active

### Single-bubble dominant-speaker presentation

- [x] Start an isolated `codex/` branch from current `origin/beta` in `mvp_chat_for_codex_only`.
- [x] Restore one bubble per AI reply and select its avatar from the speaker with the greatest total spoken text.
- [x] Fall back to the game cover for narration, unknown/side characters, and characters without a dedicated portrait.
- [x] Replace the Terrace in the City cover with a realistic Tokyo house asset.
- [x] Run focused/full tests and verify desktop/mobile locally.
- [ ] Rebase onto current beta, push to beta, then verify the hosted API and UI in desktop/mobile browsers.

### Six Strangers researched atlas and isolated Codex checkout

- [x] Clone latest beta into `mvp_chat_for_codex_only`; create `codex/six-strangers-world-atlas`.
- [x] Restore artwork and reusable map/location/route models without touching the shared checkout.
- [x] Model all supplied research IDs, uncertainty, area containers, and estimated travel relationships.
- [x] Finish reusable map UI and verify desktop/mobile behavior locally (Chromium + iPhone 13 WebKit; no page errors or failed requests).
- [ ] Run the full suite, integrate latest beta changes, and retest as needed.
- [ ] Commit, deploy beta, and verify live artwork, data, and interactions.

- [x] Finalize the two-story catalog: keep only IU Murder Mystery and Six Strangers, delete stale inactive games, and align runtime tests to the active catalogue.
- [x] Keep the server-backed default persona system and temp persona flow for the active titles.
- [ ] Push the final beta-ready branch after the live validation step.

## Consumed History

- 2026-03-21: Initialized canonical intermediate-task workflow file.
- 2026-03-22: Save/resume hardening complete.
	- Added persisted runtime snapshots for `character_graph`, `character_locations`, `last_turn_*`, and `session_chunk_store` facts in `state_json`.
	- Added restore logic to rehydrate runtime graph edge state and session BM25 chunks after cache miss/restart.
	- Synced Home-page resume sources to backend `/api/user/sessions` cache so Home and My Games resume the same sessions.
	- Verification: `C:/Users/Christian/miniconda3/envs/storieschat/python.exe -m pytest -q` -> `414 passed, 1 xpassed`.
- 2026-03-22: Cloudflare routing/control-plane documentation hardening complete.
	- Documented current path-based Cloudflare behavior for `storieschat.ai` (`/beta/*` to beta origin, catch-all to prod origin).
	- Added explicit tamper vectors showing how domain-preserving reroutes to different Railway projects can happen via Cloudflare changes.
	- Added required controls: least-privilege tokens, change approval, audit log review, synthetic origin-identity checks, and incident response steps.

## Cleanup Rules (Quick Reference)

1. Keep only open items in `Active`.
2. Move completed lists to `Consumed History` at task completion.
3. If this file exceeds ~200 lines, archive older consumed entries to `ARCHIVE_TASKS_INTERMEDIATE.md`.
