# Intermediate Tasks (Canonical)

Use this file as the single source of truth for intermediate execution tasks.

## Active

- [x] Finalize the two-story catalog: keep only IU Murder Mystery and Six Strangers, delete stale inactive games, and align runtime tests to the active catalogue.
- [x] Keep the server-backed default persona system and temp persona flow for the active titles.
- [ ] Push the final beta-ready branch after the live validation step.

## Consumed History

- 2026-03-21: Initialized canonical intermediate-task workflow file.
- 2026-03-22: Save/resume hardening complete.
	- Added persisted runtime snapshots for `character_graph`, `character_locations`, `last_turn_*`, and `session_chunk_store` facts in `state_json`.
	- Added restore logic to rehydrate runtime graph edge state and session BM25 chunks after cache miss/restart.
	- Synced Home-page resume sources to backend `/api/user/sessions` cache so Home and My Games resume the same sessions.
	- Verification: `C:/Users/Christian/miniconda3/envs/storieschat/python.exe -m pytest -q` -> `414 passed, 1 xpassed`.
- 2026-03-22: Cloudflare routing/control-plane documentation hardening complete.
	- Documented current path-based Cloudflare behavior for `storieschat.ai` (`/beta/*` to beta origin, catch-all to prod origin).
	- Added explicit tamper vectors showing how domain-preserving reroutes to different Railway projects can happen via Cloudflare changes.
	- Added required controls: least-privilege tokens, change approval, audit log review, synthetic origin-identity checks, and incident response steps.

## Cleanup Rules (Quick Reference)

1. Keep only open items in `Active`.
2. Move completed lists to `Consumed History` at task completion.
3. If this file exceeds ~200 lines, archive older consumed entries to `ARCHIVE_TASKS_INTERMEDIATE.md`.
